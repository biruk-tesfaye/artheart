# ArtHeart - A SvelteKit implementation

This project is a demonstration of a SvelteKit implementation based on a Figma design. Originally created for a client project, it has now been made public as a showcase of my development skills and to benefit the wider community.

- Main website [`app.artheart.ai`](https://app.artheart.ai).
- Current Figma design [`figma.com/file/...`](https://www.figma.com/file/KVqTmgW68PNa4gDV1rKga1/Master-Design?mode=dev).

> Note: The current implementation is intended solely as an example to demonstrate the user interface (UI) implementation of a single page. It is important to keep in mind that the folder structure and components used in this example may not be suitable for the entire design and may need to be modified accordingly

## Developing

npm install

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:
